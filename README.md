# Readme for website assignment (S10222282, Koh En Yang)

The purpose of the website is to inform users about the purpose of the new social project, Psyche, as well as provide the means for users to send enquiries about the social project.
The intent of users would be to learn more about the project and understand the project's purpose.

The website is catering to users who want to know more about the social project, most likely mental health professionals, journalists and youths.
These users would want to understand more about the project and learn about the vision and purpose of the project.

Hence, the website's content is designed to meet the needs and expectations of these different groups of users and displays the purpose of the social project through non-text means.

For example, smooth and futuristic animations such as circular particle movements and bright primary colours place emphasis on the future-oriented aspect of the project.
Meanwhile, the homepage utilises a mixture of two animations edited from open source designs in order to convey the image of candlelights among a bed of stars.
These designs have a subliminal message of hope, futurism and human warmth.

The key value that the website is providing to users is an interactive and non-conventional explanation on what the Psyche social project is through the use of aesthetic features and short summaries.
This is keeping to the principle of "show, don't tell" by avoiding lengthy, esoteric descriptions and also differentiating itself from plain webpage designs.


This website references open source code from multiple source, and all open source are modified and improved upon.
Some modifications and improvements made would be the fusion of multiple pieces of code, altering the colours and rotation of the animations, expanding or reducing the size of certain designs and many more other edits.
